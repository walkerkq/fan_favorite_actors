# Fan Favorite Actors  

Moviegoers turn to critics like Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel for an expert’s insight into a film’s quality. Websites like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and Metascore aggregate these reviews into what should be a pretty reliable evaluation, but often is a little off the mark.

Besides the obvious merits of certain genres (action movies with terrific explosions or dramas with well-written, nuanced dialogue), what might make a moviegoer enjoy a movie more or less than a critic? It could be an immeasurable “fun” index that stems from a certain premise or actor - maybe fan affinity for an actor or actress can draw focus away from a flawed plot or poor storytelling. 
  
**The question: which actors do fans love despite poor critic reviews?**    
  
For a good mix of movies and actors, I selected 30 top-grossing actors and actresses, 30 critically acclaimed (recent winners of the Academy Award for Best Actor/Actress), and 75 of the most popular/prolific actors and actresses I could think of. Voice-only and special effects actors were excluded. After scraping IMDb 
for the ID numbers for each actor’s movie credits, I used the [Open Movie Database (OMDb)](http://www.omdbapi.com/) 
to collect information (including Metascore, IMDb rating and Rotten Tomatoes ratings) for more than 3000 movies. 
[Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about/) scores were used in this analysis. Both are scores out of 100, 
but they are calculated a little differently. The critic score (“tomatometer”) is the percentage of “fresh” critic reviews, while the 
audience score (“tomatoUserMeter”) is the percentage of user reviews that are at or above 3.5/5.
